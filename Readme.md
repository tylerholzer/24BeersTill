# 24BeersTill

## About
24BeersTill is a web site for managing groups of beer sharing in the specific rules laid out below. My brother created
this idea a couple years ago and ran it with his friends. The basic idea is that you get a group of 6 people together
and everyone buys four 6packs of different beers. You then meet up, and divide the beer so everyone ends up with 24
different beers (assuming no repeats).

## Rules
* Every participant buys 4 different six packs of beer
* Repeats by different participants are allowed, but if you wish, you can discuss what you are bringing to minimize the
chances of repeats. Or don't so its a surprise. (Planned feature is a repeat detector)
* Don't be an asshole and bring any of the big domestics. The idea is to try new beers.
* Don't be an asshole and complain about the overall value of the beer that a participant brings
* You don't have to drink one beer a day. Feel free to drink them at your own pace. The basic idea is just to drink them
in the roughly 24 day period so you can share the experience.
* Beers can be drank in any order.
* Try every beer with an open mind, even if it is a style you normally dislike. You only have one and this is a great
opportunity to try something you wouldnâ€™t normally buy. Maybe you'll find a new favorite.
* Have fun and enjoy the beer
